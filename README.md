# Graph Traversal and Shortest Path Visualizer
The Graph Traversal and Shortest Path Visualizer is a Java-based application that demonstrates common graph algorithms, including **DFS, BFS, and Shortest Path**. It allows users to load a graph from file input, visualize traversals, and compute shortest paths between vertices. This project showcases knowledge of data structures, algorithms, and Java programming.

## Features
- **Load Graphs from File** – Import graph structures from `testGraph.txt`  
- **Graph Traversal** – Run and display **Depth-First Search (DFS)** and **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**  
- **Shortest Path Calculation** – Find and display the shortest path between two vertices  
- **Custom Graph Classes** – Implements `Graph`, `Vertex`, `Edge`, and `Distance` for graph representation  
- **Interactive Menu** – Console-based menu for choosing algorithms (DFS, BFS, Shortest Path)  

## Tech Stack 
- **Language:** Java  
- **IDE:** IntelliJ IDEA / NetBeans / Eclipse  
- **UI/IO:** Java Swing (for visualization) & console menu  
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub  

## Installation & Setup
1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Graph-Traversal-and-Shortest-Path-Visualizer.git
   cd graph-traversal-visualizer/src/finlab

2. **Compile the project**
   ```bash
   javac *.java

3. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   java Main

4. **Provide input**
   - Graph data is loaded from testGraph.txt
   - Follow the console menu to select:
     - 1 → Load File
     - 2 → Depth-First Traversal
     - 3 → Breadth-First Traversal
     - 4 → Shortest Path

## Usage
- Start the program and choose an algorithm from the menu
- DFS/BFS results will list the order of visited vertices
- Shortest Path will display the minimum path between chosen nodes
