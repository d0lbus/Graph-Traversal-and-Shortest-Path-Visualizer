## Group
- AQUINO, Jan Dolby
- ENCARNACION, Ma. Earl Freskkie 
- ESCANO, Nichlole Jhoy
- MALALUAN, Arvin
- RAZO, Ma. Lourdez Shaine
- SAN MIGUEL, Chloe' Lee
- TALOSIG, Manuel Allan Cian

## Specifications
```
The group is tasked to create an application having the following menu options:
1 load file containing the graph's data
2 Perform Depth First Traversal of the graph
3 Perform Breadth First Traversal of the graph
4 Show the shortest path from one vertex to another
5 Exit

When the user chooses option 1, the program shows the content-format of the file that the file should have so
that your program will be able to read the text file properly. Display a message whether the file has been read
successfully or not. 

Note: Assume that all the edges will have a positive weight.

If the user chooses options 2 or 3, the starting vertex will be asked from the user and the program will
perform the respective chosen traversal approach with the specified vertex. The result of traversal is then
shown to the user or an error message may be shown if the starting vertex is not valid or if there is no
successfully loaded graph.

If the user chooses option 4, the user is asked to input the starting vertex. The program will then look for the
shortest path from the starting vertex to all the other (possible) vertices in the graph using Dijkstra's single
source shortest path algorithm. Display the weight/cost of traversing the graph from the starting vertex to the
corresponding vertices.

The program exits when the user has chosen option 5 from the menu of options.
